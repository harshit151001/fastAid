          This Website is a charitable and gratuitous not-for-profit initiative
          created in the spirit of helping each other. The Developers of this
          Website have sought to put together a platform where people from all
          over the country can upload information that can help procure the
          requisite medical assistance and supplies for COVID-infected patients.
          Along with the Developers, several Volunteers collate data from
          various sources and add it to this Website. The Website is open for
          anyone to upload information of suppliers, etc. Due to the
          unavailability of sufficient resources or any institutional support,
          the Developers and Volunteers associated with this Website are unable
          to verify all the information being uploaded on this Website. Please
          be aware that several media reports of anti-social elements misused
          social media and platforms like these to dupe people by taking advance
          payments and not making any supplies or making inadequate supplies. In
          light of the same, please take due care and do your due diligence
          before you deal with any supplier, etc., listed on this Website.
          Please be advised to use the information available on this Website
          solely at your own risk. The Developers and Volunteers of the Website
          wish to categorically state that we don't take any responsibility
          towards the authenticity or integrity of the information available on
          this Website. In case of any supplier, etc., defrauding any user of
          any money, providing an inadequate supply, or engaging in any other
          illegal behavior or act, the Developers and Volunteers shall NOT be
          held liable. Last but not least, we understand that you are likely
          suffering from a tough time if you are here. We wish for you to stay
          strong and for your loved ones to get well soon! Together, we'll beat
          this pandemic.
